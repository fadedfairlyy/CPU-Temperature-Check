# CPU Temperature Check
Powershell script using WMI to check the CPU temperature.

# Limitations:
Windows-only: This script only works on Windows.
Not all systems support this: Some systems may not expose temperature data through WMI.
Mobile devices (iPhone, iPad, Android): PowerShell doesn't natively support querying CPU temperatures on mobile devices. You would need to use device-specific apps or tools (like Core Temp or HWMonitor for PCs or iStat for Macs).

# How to Run
Download cpu_temperature_check.ps1, right click it, and run it with powershell.
